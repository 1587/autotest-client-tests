Description:
This module provides the Python bindings to libcurl. PycURL is a Python interface to libcurl. PycURL can be used to fetch objects identified by a URL from a Python program, similar to the urllib Python module. PycURL is mature, very fast, and supports a lot of features.

libcurl is a client-side URL transfer library supporting FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, GOPHER, TELNET, DICT, FILE and LDAP. libcurl also supports HTTPS certificates, HTTP POST, HTTP PUT, FTP uploads, proxies, cookies, basic authentication, file transfer resume of FTP sessions, HTTP proxy tunneling and more.

PycURL is very fast (esp. for multiple concurrent operations) and very feature complete, but has a somewhat complex interface.

2. Start vncviewer from another machine or your laptop
# vncviewer <IP of testmachine>:<port number>

3. Open a terminal and go to fivextra path and run test
# cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/python-pycurl/
# ./python-pycurl.sh

To run individual test,
# cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/python-pycurl/tests/
# python <testname>.py
