Description:

XML::XQL - This is a perl module that allows you to perform XQL queries on XML
object trees.

XQL is designed specifically for XML documents. It is a general purpose query
language, providing a single syntax that can be used for queries, addressing,
and patterns. XQL is concise, simple, and powerful.XQL language provides a
natural extension to the XSL pattern language. It builds upon the capabilities
XSL provides for identifying classes of nodes, by adding Boolean logic,
filters, indexing into collections of nodes, and more.
Currently only the XML::DOM module is supported, but other implementations,
like XML::Grove, may soon follow.
