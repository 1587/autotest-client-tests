vsftpd
	Test the functionality of vsftpd.
	Covered file get/put and xferlog.

	This also has two special requests that can be specified on the
	command line:

		START_SERVER
		STOP_SERVER

	These are used to start and stop the server without running any
	tests. They are used by the mod_php5 ftp testcase. It is the
	responsibility of the invoking script (e.g. mod_php5) to save and
	restore the xinetd.conf and vsftpd.conf files.
