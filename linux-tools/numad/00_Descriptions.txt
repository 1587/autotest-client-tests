Numad is a system daemon that monitors NUMA topology and usage. It will
       attempt  to  locate  processes  for optimum NUMA locality and affinity,
       dynamically adjusting to changing system conditions.  Numad  also  provides 
       guidance  to  assist management applications with initial manual
       binding of CPU and memory resources for their processes.
       
  About NUMA:
        Non Uniform Memory Access provides a method by a which a system can schedule
        a process or task on a Node which has the required CPU resource and memory
        for it to optimally execute.
        A node is: a region of memory in which every byte has the same distance from each CPU.

If a two or more node system is present then, memhog ( part of numactl package) is used to test resource utilization with the -u, -S and -w options .
memhog reserves the amount of memory specified in the parameter as its own , so process affinity to nodes can be checked with that.o

HOW TO RUN:
./numad.sh
numad.sh is the shell script which runs all the tests
