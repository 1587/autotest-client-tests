This module includes a number of smaller modules suited for manipulation of time and date strings with Perl.  In particular, the
Date::Format and Date::Parse modules can display and read times and dates in various formats, providing a more reliable interface to
textual representations of points in time.

       The tests uses :        
       ** Date::Format - capable of formatting into several languages by creating a language specific object and calling methods
                * time2str(TEMPLATE, TIME[ZONE])
                time2str converts TIME into an ASCII string using the conversion specification given in TEMPLATE.
                ZONE if given specifies the zone which the output is required to be in, ZONE defaults to your current zone.

       ** Date::Language - Language specific date formatting and parsing

       ** Date::Parse - Parse date strings into time values

How to run the test:
-------------------
./perl-TimeDate.sh
