Description: perl-Scalar-List-Utils is the combined distribution for the scalar and list utils.

List::Util contains a selection of subroutines that people have expressed would be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage would not really be high enough to warrant the use of a keyword, and the size so small such that beingi individual extensions would be wasteful.

Scalar::Util contains a selection of subroutines that people have expressed would be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage would not really be high enough to warrant the use of a keyword, and the size so small such that being individual extensions would be wasteful.

building and running the in-built test suite is same as running individual perl scripts plus some supporting files from source.
