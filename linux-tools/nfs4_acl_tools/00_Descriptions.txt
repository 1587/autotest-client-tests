Note:
----------

This package contains commandline and GUI ACL utilities for the Linux
NFSv4 client

The binaries provided by package includes:
/usr/bin/nfs4_editfacl
/usr/bin/nfs4_getfacl
/usr/bin/nfs4_setfacl

These are to manipulate NFSv4 file/directory access control lists.

nfs4_setfacl manipulates the NFSv4 Access Control List (ACL)
of one or more files (or directories), provided
they are on a mounted NFSv4 filesystem which supports ACLs.

nfs4_editfacl is equivalent to nfs4_setfacl -e.
This will edit the file's ACL in the editor
defined in the EDITOR environment variable (DEFAULT: vi(1))
and set the resulting ACL

nfs4_getfacl will display the NFSv4 Access Control List (ACL)
for file (a file or directory), provided file
is on a mounted NFSv4 filesystem which supports ACLs.

In nfs4_acl, an ACL is a list of permissions
associated with a file or directory and
consists of one or more Access Control Entries (ACEs)
