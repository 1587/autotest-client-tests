Description: It is a highly-efficient and highly-secure Mail
Transport Agent written by Wietse Venema. Developed by Wietse Venema's, 
this mailer started its life at IBM research as an alternative to the 
widely-used Sendmail program. Postfix attempts to be fast, easy to administer,
and secure. The outside of the mailer looks similar to sendmail but the inside
is completely different. Sendmail is implemented as one large monolithic program
that does everything. One large program certainly makes it easy to share data 
between different parts of the system. Unfortunately, one large program also makes 
it easy to make fatal mistakes. Postfix is based on semi-resident, mutually-cooperating, 
processes that perform specific tasks for each other, without any particular parent-child
relationship. Postfix is implemented as a resident master server that runs Postfix daemon
processes on demand. There are 2 such daemons -- 1) daemon processes to send or receive network
mail messages, 2) daemon processes to deliver mail locally.
Postfix is intended to be a sendmail replacement. For this reason it tries to
be compatible with existing infrastructure.
