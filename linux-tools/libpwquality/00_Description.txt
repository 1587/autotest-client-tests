pwscore tool: reads the password to be checked from the standard input. Optional argument is an user name for additional checks.
pwmake tool: generates a random password Required argument is number of bits of entropy used to generate the password. 
PAM module: pam_pwquality Linux PAM module that can be used instead of pam_cracklib to disallow weak new passwords when user's login password is changed.
