NOTE: The elfutils tests are subpackaged with the rpm build process.

The TESTS file in the current directory contains the "individual" tests to be executed.
This list is manually created from the "make check" output. Typical output looks like:

[root@testshost]# make check
make  check-TESTS
make[1]: Entering directory `/home/suzie/rpmbuild/BUILD/elfutils-0.147/tests'
Extracting symbols... done
PASS: run-arextract.sh
PASS: run-arsymtest.sh
PASS: newfile
PASS: test-nlist
PASS: update1
PASS: update2
PASS: update3
[...]
PASS: asm-tst6
PASS: asm-tst7
PASS: asm-tst8
PASS: asm-tst9
===================
All 69 tests passed
===================

So I just picked the "test" names from the list above and created the file TESTS.
This may be updated during test merge process.
