Assumptions:

	X Windows(either X or Xvnc) and fluxbox can run properly.

Purpose:
	
	ssh includes built-in support that allows it to communicate with
	ssh-agent, allowing ssh to acquire your decrypted private keys without 
        prompting you for a password for every single new connection. With 
        ssh-agent you simply use ssh-add to add your private keys to 
	ssh-agent's cache. 

	When you use ssh-add to add a decrypted private key to the ssh-agent 
	cache, you need to provide the password. The openssh-askpass package
        provides a password dialog under the X Windows System.

Test:
	0. backup /root/.ssh/id_dsa and /root/.ssh/id_dsa.pub.
	1. generate dsa key with passphrase
	  ssh-keygen -t dsa
	  Generating public/private dsa key pair.
	  Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_dsa): (PRESS ENTER)
	  Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): (ENTER A PASSWORD)
	  Enter same passphrase again: (RENTER THE PASSWORD)
	  Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_dsa.
	  Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_dsa.pub.

	2. start ssh-agent
	  eval `ssh-agent`
	  #This command tells bash to run ssh-agent and then evaluate ssh-agent's output.
	  #Invoked this way (with back-quotes, not normal single quotes), 
           the SSH_AGENT_PID and SSH_AUTH_SOCK variables get set and exported 
           by your shell, making these variables available to any new processes 
	   you may start during your login session.
         
	3. start X-Windows or Xvnc(to connect via vncviewer) and fluxbox
	  export DISPLAY=:0.0
	  startx (or Xvnc)
	  fluxbox &
         
	4. click right button and select run, or open an xterm console, type in the command to run: 
           "SSH_ASKPASS=/usr/libexec/openssh/ssh-askpass ssh-add < /dev/null".

	5. you should see a dialog for input passphrase of the decrypted private
	   key, enter the password.
	
	6. use command "ssh-add -l" to verify the key has added to ssh agent cache.   

	7. copy back the backup id_dsa and id_dsa.pub if they were there before this test.
