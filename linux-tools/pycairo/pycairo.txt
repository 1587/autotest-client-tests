1. cd to /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/pycairo/tests
2. There are 7 manual testcases, 6 in the dir "gtk" and 1 in the dir "cairo_snippets"
3. cd to gtk
4. Run the tests individually , For example -- ./cairo-demo.py
   Each test attempts to draw various types of images with python code.
5. Each test will pop-out a window with an image. Verify the image and close the image window.
   *cairo-demon.py -- It will display an image with some geometrical shape.
		      Verify that the image is not distorted.
   *cairo-knockout.py -- It will display an image with 3 partially overlapped circle of red,green and
		      blue colour on top of a black circle which is on top of a chess-board design.
   *hangman.py -- As the name suggests, it is an image of a pedestal where
		  people are executed by hanging. The colour is light brown.
   *lsystem.py -- It displays a lindenmeyer system. It is drawn by recursively
                  designing the same shape by changing the dimensions. To visualize a
                  lindenmeyer system , search the term in google images.
   *png_view.py -- It just displays the file given to it as output. Run it as-
                 ./png_view.py /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/pycairo/tests/cairo_snippets/data/romedalen.png
   *text.py -- The image displayed is of the words "Hello World" inside a blue
                rectangle
6. cd to /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/pycairo/tests/cairo_snippets
7. Run the test "snippets_gtk.py" similarly as the above tests .
   *snippets_gtk.py -- It will display a window with three different parts.
                 The top-half of the window has some code in it .verify that this part of the
                 window can be scrolled. The bottom half of the window is
                 divided into two parts (left and right). The left half of the window contains
                 names of various geometrical shapes (eg, arc, clip, ellipse). Click on the names,
                 one by one and see that the shapes are displayed as images on the right side of the bottom half.
                 Verify that the images are displayed according to the names.
