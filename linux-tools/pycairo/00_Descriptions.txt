Cairo is a library for drawing vector graphics which do not lose clarity
while resizing or transforming. Pycairo is a python module which provides
wrapper over cairo commands. Some of the tests available in source can
be run in command line to generate pdf/png/ps files whose type can then
be examined later by commands such as identify. Some tests are in manual
category to verify through GTK.

To execute FIV tests, run ./pycairo.sh
