The Text::Iconv module provides a Perl interface to the iconv() function as defined by the Single UNIX Specification. The convert()
method converts the encoding of characters in the input string from the fromcode codeset to the tocode codeset and returns the result.
Settings of fromcode and tocode and their permitted combinations are implementation-dependent. Valid values are specified in the system
documentation.

It can be used to create a converter object which maps from one encoding to another and then pass the object a string to convert
example :

$converter = Text::Iconv->new('UTF-8', 'ISO8859-1');
print $converter->convert($string);


Functionality of the test : The test in the source  expects two array references, each listing all the alternative names to try for the source and target codesets.  If the
codeset is not supported (at least not under any of the names that  were given), it returns 0.  If the call to iconv_open() fails due to
other reasons, it returns undef.  Otherwise a Text::Iconv object for  the requested conversion is returned.

How to run the test:
--------------------
./perl-Text-Iconv.sh
