This packages provides a perl module to generate checksums from strings and
from files. The crc32() function shall return the new checksum value.

The checksums are the same as those calculated by ZMODEM, PKZIP, PICCHECK and
many others.

There's another perl module called String::CRC, which supports calculation of
CRC values of various widths (i.e. not just 32 bits), but the generated sums
differ from those of the programs mentioned above.

CRC stands for - Cyclic Redundancy Check checksum

Functionality of the Test: Tests the CRC of a - string variable, string, sub-strings and  file

How to run the test:
-------------------
./perl-String-CRC32.sh
To run a individual test: perl t/<testname.t>
