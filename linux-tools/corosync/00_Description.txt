The project provides four C programming interfaces features:

    A closed process group communication model with virtual synchrony guarantees for creating replicated state machines.
    A simple availability manager that restarts the application process when it has failed.
    A configuration and statistics in-memory database that provide the ability to set, retrieve, and receive change notifications of information.
    A quorum system that notifies applications when quorum is achieved or lost.
