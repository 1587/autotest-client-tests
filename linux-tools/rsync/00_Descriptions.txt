rsync â€” a fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool

Rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool.
It can copy locally, to/from another host over any remote shell
or to/from a remote rsync daemon. It offers a large number of options
that control every aspect of its behavior and permit very
flexible specification of the set of files to be copied.
It is famous for its delta-transfer algorithm,
which reduces the amount of data sent over the network
by sending only the differences between the source files
and the existing files in the destination.

Usage:
Access via remote shell:
Pull: rsync [OPTION...] [USER@]HOST:SRC... [DEST]
Push: rsync [OPTION...] SRC... [USER@]HOST:DEST

Rsync can also be run as a daemon, in which case the options
like "--daemon - run as an rsync daemon" is accepted.
