Digest::HMAC - Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication

HMAC is used for message integrity checks between two parties that share a
secret key, and works in combination with some other Digest algorithm, usually
MD5 or SHA-1. The HMAC mechanism is described in RFC 2104.

How to run tests:
------------------
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/perl-Digest-HMAC
./perl-Digest-HMAC.sh

    or

perl t/XXX.t
