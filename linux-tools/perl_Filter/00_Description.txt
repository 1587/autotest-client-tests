perl-Filter is a little-known feature of Perl called source filters .Source filters alter the program text of a module before Perl sees it, much as a C preprocessor alters the source text of a C program before the compiler sees it. The original purpose of source filters was to let us encrypt our program source to prevent casual piracy.

building and running the in-built test suite is same as running individual perl scripts plus some supporting files from source .

How to run test
