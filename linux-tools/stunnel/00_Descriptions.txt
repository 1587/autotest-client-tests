stunnel : Stunnel, is an SSL-wrapper utility, that allows plain text communication
to be encrypted during transmission. Stunnel can be used to encrypt connections
involving  any "single-port TCP service" in SSL tunnels, without any modifications
to the service itself. "single-port TCP service,"  is  a service that listens for
connections on a single TCP port without subsequently using additional ports for other functions.

The test case execution flow :
------------------------------
1. Creation of certificates using openssl.
2. Make changes to some system configuration files.
3. Bind rsync to the stunnel port.
4. Start stunnel and keep it running.
5. Transfer file by Rsync.
6. Verify that the files are received.

How to run the test :
-------------------
./stunnel.sh
