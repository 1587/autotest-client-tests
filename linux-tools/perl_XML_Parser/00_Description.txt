XML::Parser - A perl module for parsing XML documents

XML::Parser is an event-based parser. Prior to parsing the document,
an application registers various event handlers with the parser. Then, as
the document is parsed, the handlers are called when the relevant parts
are recognized.

Most utilities need only register 3 handlers: start, end, and character
handlers.
The start handler is called when an XML start tag is recognized;
the end handler is called on recognition of an end tag; and the character
handler
is called for non-markup content inside an element

Usage:
To run all tests:

./perl-XML-Parser.sh

To run test individually:
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/perl-XML-Parser
perl t/<test.t>
