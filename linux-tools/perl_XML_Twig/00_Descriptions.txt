perl-XML-Twig: is a XML transformation module. This module provides a way to process XML documents. It is built on
top of XML::Parser.  XML::Twig offers a tree interface to the document, while allowing you to output the parts of it that have been
completely processed.  It allows minimal resource (CPU and memory) usage by building the tree only for the parts of the documents that
need actual processing, through the use of the twig_roots and twig_print_outside_roots options.

Its strong points: can be used to process huge documents while still being in tree mode; not bound by DOM or SAX, so it is very perlish and
offers a very comprehensive set of methods; simple to use; DWIMs as much as possible 

How to run the test:
-------------------
