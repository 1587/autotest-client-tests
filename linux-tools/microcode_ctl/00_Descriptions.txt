The Microcode_ctl utility is a companion to the IA32 microcode
which updates the microcode on Intel x86/x86-64 CPU's

The utility has two uses:
       a) it decodes and sends new microcode to the kernel driver to be uploaded to Intel IA32 processors. (Pentium Pro, PII, Celeron, PIII, Xeon, Pentium 4, etc)
       b) it  signals  the  kernel  driver to release the buffers containing the copy of microcode data actually applied to given CPU.

HOW TO RUN
-------------------
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/microcode_ctl
./microcode_ctl.sh
