Pexpect is a pure Python module that makes Python a better tool for controlling and automating other programs.
Pexpect is similar to the Don Libes `Expect` system, but Pexpect as a different interface that is easier to understand.
 Pexpect is basically a pattern matching system. It runs programs and watches output.
When output matches a given pattern Pexpect can respond as if a human were typing responses.
Pexpect can be used for automation, testing, and screen scraping.
Pexpect can be used for automating interactive console applications such as ssh, ftp, passwd, telnet, etc.

Modules provided by pexpect:
pexpect - The main module
pxssh - Pexpect SSH is an extension of 'pexpect.spawn' that specializes in SSH.
fdpexpect - fdpexpect extension of 'pexpect.spawn' that uses an open file descriptor.
          You can pass it any file descriptor and use pexpect commands to
           match output from your fd.
screen - This represents a virtual 'screen'.
ANSI - This parses ANSI/VT-100 terminal escape codes.
