udftools.sh

Description :
UDF a newer CDROM filesystem standard that's required for
DVD roms. It's meant to be a replacement for the ISO9660
filesystem used on today's CDROMs, but the immediate impact
for most will be DVD. DVD multimedia cdroms use the UDF
filesystem to contain MPEG audio and video streams.
To access DVD cdroms you would need a DVD cdrom drive, the
kernel driver for the cdrom drive, some kind of MPEG video
support, and a UDF filesystem driver (like this one).   See
the Livid project for news and software for playing DVDs.
UDF can also be used by CD-R and CD-RW recorders in what's
known as "packet writing". By using "packet writing", CDs
can be written to more efficiently, in both disk space used,
and the time it takes to write the CD. Adaptec's DirectCD is
a Win95/WinNT example of packet writing, using the UDF
version 1.5 filesystem.

This test covers: chkudf, mkudffs, pktsetup, cdrwtool

TODO: real test with CDRW/DVD drive. H/W dependent.

Notes:
Due to lack of mrw drive in CSTL, cdmrw is not tested now. However
the following are steps to test this command.
1. Asssume /dev/sr1 is the device file for a mrw drive.
2. Put a blank CD-RW disk into mrw drive.
3. cdmrw -d /dev/sr1 -f ull
   It is to format a mrw drive. Optionaly we can add -p to poll its
   status of formating.
4. mkudffs --media-type=cdrw /dev/sr1
   create a udf file system on the CD-RW disk.
5. mount /dev/sr1 /mnt/cdrom
6. Assume test.iso is of size 600M.
   cp test.iso /mnt/cdrom
   cp /mnt/cdrom/test.iso ~
