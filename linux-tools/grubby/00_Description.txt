grubby  is  a command line tool for updating and displaying information about
the configuration files for the grub, lilo, elilo (ia64),  yaboot (powerpc)
and zipl (s390) boot loaders. It is primarily designed to be used from scripts
which install new kernels and need to find information about the current boot
environment.

To run the tests:
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/grubby
./grubby.sh
