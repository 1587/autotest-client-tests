Testcase	:	acpid - ACPI Daemon
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
	ACPI daemon runs in userspace reading the events from /proc/acpi/event to which ACPI events are reported by the kernel. The daemon could
be made to execute specific actions upon the events by specifying the rules in the conf/ directory. It also allows clients to connect to the socket
and sends the events to all the connected clients. Refer. man acpid for more details.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Howto		:	Execute acpid.sh testcase
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Files/Dirs	:	acpid.sh	- Wrapper for acpid-test.sh. This is in place due to a bash bug (LTC #50650)
			acpid-test.sh	- The actual testcases
			conf/		- Configuration directory for acpid rules/actions
			log/		- Log files for the testcases
			data/		- Expected results and other misc. data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description	:
	We create a FIFO file on the fly to simulate the behaviour of kernel generated events. The acpid is made to read the events
from the fifo making it behave like the real acpi/event file waiting for the events. The testcase writes the events to the pipe to simulate
the generation of the events.

	The client behaviour is tested using the acpi_listen program shipped with the acpid package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test Scenarios	: 

	We test 4 scenarios.

	1)	Test the following :
		a) acpid starts fine
		b) acpi client is able to connect to the server (acpi_listen)

	2) 	Test the -S option :

		a) Start the acpid with -S option (by setting the SOCKOPT env. variable in the tests)

		b) Try connecting the client to the server. We should receive "Connection refused" error.

	3)	Test the rules and related actions for the acpi events.

		a) Start the acpid 
		b) Also start the acpi client
		c) Now generate the events by writing some events to the EVENT_FILE.
		d) We should see the action taken by the acpid with the rules in conf/ and also the client's out put.

	4)	Test the SIGHUP behaviour of acpid. ACPID should reload the rules on SIGHUP.

		a) Start the acpid as well as the clients.
		b) Generate the events by writing the data to EVENT_FILE
		c) Now add a new rule to the conf/ directory
		d) Send a SIGHUP to the acpid
		e) Check the results for the client and actions. We should see the actions for the new rule added.

NOTE:	There is one environment variable that you could try experimenting with in case of failures. 

	*) INTERVAL 	-	In acpid-test.sh, is the interval to wait for the acpid daemon to settle itself before the client tries to connect.
				The default is 1sec. You could increase it to see if it helps in getting rid of the problems. 
				
				There is really no way to find out if the acpid has finished reading the rules and configs.
