perl-Date-Manip package provides series of modules designed to make any common
date/time operation easy to do. Operations such as comparing two times,
determining a data a given amount of time from another, or parsing
international times are all easily done. It deals with time as it is used in
the Gregorian calendar (the one currently in use) with full support for time
changes due to daylight saving time.
