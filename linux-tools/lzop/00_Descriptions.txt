lzop is a compression utility which is designed to be a companion to gzip. It
is based on the LZO library and its main advantages over gzip are much higher
compression and decompression speed at the cost of compression ratio.

lzop was designed with reliability, speed, portibility and as a reasonable
drop-in compatiblity to gzip.

HOW TO RUN:
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/lzop
./lzop.sh
