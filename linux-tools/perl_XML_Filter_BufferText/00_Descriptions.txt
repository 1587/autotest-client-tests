This is a very simple filter. One common cause of grief (and programmer
error) is that XML parsers aren't required to provide character events in
one chunk. They can, but are not forced to, and most don't. This filter
does the trivial but oft-repeated task of putting all characters into a
single event.

The test uses  XML::Filter::BufferText - Filter to put all characters() in one event
and checks the Buffer count and also the contents in it.
ok($TestBuffer::COUNT == 2);
ok($TestBuffer::DATA  eq 'COMMENT');

How to run the test:
-------------------
./perl-XML-Filter-BufferText.sh
