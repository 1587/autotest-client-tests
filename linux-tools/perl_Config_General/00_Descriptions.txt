This module opens a config file and parses its contents for
you. After parsing the module returns a hash structure which contains
the representation of the config file.
The format of config files supported by Config::General is inspired by
the well known Apache config format, in fact, this module is 100%
read-compatible with Apache configs, but you can also just use simple
name/value pairs in your config files.
In addition to the capabilities of an Apache config file it supports
some enhancements such as here-documents, C-style comments or
multiline options. It is also possible to save the config back to
disk, which makes the module a perfect backend for configuration
interfaces.
It is possible to use variables in config files and there exists also
support for object oriented access to the configuration.
