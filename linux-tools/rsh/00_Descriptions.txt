rsh test case


INTRODUCTION

	test rsh packages commands


COVERAGE

	rsh rexec rcp;


HOWTO RUN

	1. Make sure environment variables RSH_SERVER,
           RSH_USER(non-root) and RSH_PASSWD are set properly.

	2. ./rsh.sh

NOTE

	Environment variables RSH_SERVER, RSH_USER(non-root) and
        RSH_PASSWD could be set manually or thru ABAT machines.xml

	In CDL, test0 is maintained to be a suitable RSH_SERVER for
	this test, thus this test could be run as this:

	# RSH_SERVER=test0 RSH_USER=fivtest RSH_PASSWD=fivtest ./rsh.sh
