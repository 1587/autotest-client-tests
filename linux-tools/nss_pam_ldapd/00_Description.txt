TEST: nss_ldap

AUTHOR:	Suzuki K P <suzuki@in.ibm.com>


What is NSS ?

NSS is a mechanism to lookup for various information from the system. Things like user, group, passwd, hosts, networks, services, protocols, rpc etc.


What is nss_ldap ?

nss_ldap test provides NSS library functions to retrieve information from an LDAP server. 

Testcase:

1) Setup an LDAP server with NIS information.

2) Setup client lookup to go to ldap server. (Modififying /etc/nsswitch.conf & /etc/nslcd.conf)

3) Perform lookups for user, group, host, network, protocol, service.

4) Restore the client


FILES:

db/		: Path for LDAP Server database

ldapserver/ 	: Configs for LDAP Server and databases. 

	nslcd.conf	- Client configs for ldap. This becomes /etc/nslcd.conf
	
	ldap-master.conf	- This is how the slapd.conf will look like. We create it runtime

	nis_sample.ldif		- Sample definitions of NIS entries.

	nsswitch.conf.ldap	- Config for nsswitch to use ldap. Becomes /etc/nsswitch.conf
			(Note: hosts start with file, because, we have to find the ldapserver using this.)

	schema/			- Contains standard definitions about LDAP classes.

log/		:	Where the logs of helper programs and the LDAP server are placed

results/	:	Expected results from the programs


utils/		:	Helper programs to do the real test for nss_ldap.


HOWTO Run :
===========

./nss_ldap.sh

HOWTO Analyze
==============

The log/ directory will have all the log files. You may check them to find what really went wrong.

TODO:

Extend this to pam_ldap. Add a user/passwd to the server and use it to test some command like vsftp. May use the expect scripts to automate password.
