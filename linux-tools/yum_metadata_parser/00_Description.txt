The yum-metadata-parser packages provide a fast metadata parser for Yum implemented in C.
This provides module sqlitecachec which is required for yum to work.

rpm -ql yum-metadata-parser
/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/_sqlitecache.so
/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/sqlitecachec.py
/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/sqlitecachec.pyc
/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/sqlitecachec.pyo

These modules are covered by yum. While running any yum commands, yum update or install etc,
it uses these modules. 

This testcase covers additional scenarios like:
1) Corrupt the yum metadata by modifying the primary.xml and verify if yum detects the same
2) Verify yum works in case of yum update for dependencies.
3) Check whether yum works with "metadata_expire" set in /etc/yum.conf file.
