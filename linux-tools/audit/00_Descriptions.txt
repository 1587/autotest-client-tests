auditd is the userspace component to the Linux Auditing System. It's
responsible for writing audit records to the disk. Viewing the logs
is done  with  the  ausearch  or aureport utilities. Configuring the
audit rules is done with the auditctl utility.

During startup, the rules in /etc/audit/audit.rules are read by auditctl.
The audit daemon itself has some configuration options that the admin may
wish to customize.They are found in the auditd.conf file.

# audit control related files
/sbin/auditctl
/etc/audit/audit.rules

# audit daemon related files
/sbin/auditd
/etc/rc.d/init.d/auditd
/etc/sysconfig/auditd
/etc/audit/auditd.conf

# audit reporting tools and files
/sbin/aureport
/sbin/ausearch
/sbin/autrace
/usr/bin/aulast
/usr/bin/aulastlog
/usr/bin/ausyscall
/var/log/audit

# audit development libraries
/usr/lib64/audit

/sbin/audispd
/etc/audisp/audispd.conf
/etc/audisp/plugins.d
/etc/audisp/plugins.d/af_unix.conf
/etc/audisp/plugins.d/syslog.conf

audit.sh is the test script which verifies the guarenteed functionality of
auditctl and audit daemon installed by the package. It also checks the tracing
and logging functionalities.
