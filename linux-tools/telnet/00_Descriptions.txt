telnet
	Test the functionality of telnet and telnetd, on the same machine.

This test will start in.telnetd directly, and call telnet client to connect telnetd via expect,
with different server and client options.


1. in.telnetd  <---> telnet:
	login with temp user, and touch a temp file, exit, and then check if the file is created.

2. in.telnetd  <---> telnet -l <username>
	login with temp user, and touch a temp file, exit, and then check if the file is created.
	Don't need to provide username at login prompt

3. in.telnetd -h <---> telnet 
	login with temp user, and touch a temp file, exit, and then check if the file is created.
	check host-specific information is printed this time.


Note: 
	1. Ensure to call /usr/bin/telnet, since there may have other type of telnet client in PATH.
	2. This test use a different port for telnetd, and start it directly, so no impact will be introduced to SUT.
	3. There's another test for telnet from LTP: network/tcp_cmds/telnet
		(setup passwordless rsh, telnet by expect).
