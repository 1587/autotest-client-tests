perl-PathTools is the combined distribution for the File::Spec and Cwd modules.
File::Spec - portably perform operations on file names. This module is designed to support operations commonly performed on file specifications, such as concatenating several directory and file names into a single path, or determining whether a path is rooted.
Cwd - get pathname of current working directory. This module provides functions for determining the pathname of the current working directory. It is recommended that getcwd (or another *cwd() function) be used in all code to ensure portability.

building and running the in-built test suite is same as running individual perl scripts plus some supporting files from source.
