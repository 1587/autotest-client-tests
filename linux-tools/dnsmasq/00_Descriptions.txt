dnsmasq is a small, lightweight, and easy-to-configure caching DNS proxy
and DHCP server targeted at small or home networks. It can serve the
names of local hosts which are not in the global DNS, and its DHCP
server integrates with its DNS server to allow hosts with DHCP-allocated
addresses to appear in the DNS along with names configured either in
each host or in its configuration file. dnsmasq supports static and
dynamic DHCP leases and even BOOTP/TFTP for network booting of diskless
hosts.

From FIV point of view, below test cases are verified by configuring
dnsmasq as:

dnsmasq server
 - configure dnsmasq for additional DNS server lookup and check if it
   caches the entries (use dig for Query Time and see if it is less
   than 10s ideally).

dhcp server
 - configure minimally dhcp settings in dnsmasq.conf and check if a
   NIC receives DHCP ip.
 - check dhcp-option 6 (for additional name server entries).
 - check if dnsmasq can recognise dhcp-host for static ip allocation.
 - check if dnsmasq can recognise /etc/ethers for static ip allocation.

tftp server
 - enable-tftp server and check simple file transfer using tftp client.

As above are server/client tests, virtual ethernet pairs are used
(ip veth peers) and checked above functionalities with them.
