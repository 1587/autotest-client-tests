Note:
About rng-tools:
-------------

rng-tools provides the daemon to use a Hardware true random number generator

The rngd daemon acts as a bridge between a Hardware TRNG (true random number generator)
and the kernel's PRNG (pseudo-random number generator).
It tests the data received from the TRNG using the FIPS 140-2 tests
to verify that it is indeed random,
and feeds the random data to the kernel entropy pool.

It provides
1) rngtest - to verify the randomness of the block of data
2) rngd - the random number generator daemon
