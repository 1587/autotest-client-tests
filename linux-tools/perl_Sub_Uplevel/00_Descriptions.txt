Sub::Uplevel - apparently run a function in a higher stack frame

Like Tcl's uplevel() function, but not quite so dangerous. The idea is just to fool caller().
All the really naughty bits of Tcl's uplevel() are avoided.
Makes the given function think it's being executed $num_frames higher than the current stack level. So when they use
caller($frames) it will actually give caller($frames + $num_frames) for them.

"uplevel" will issue a warning if $num_frames is more than the current call stack depth. 

The tests checks for the functionality like - uplevel, nested uplevel, uplevel too high, etc. 

How to run the test:
--------------------
./perl-Sub-Uplevel.sh
To run individual test: perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM" "-e" "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')" t/<testname.t>
