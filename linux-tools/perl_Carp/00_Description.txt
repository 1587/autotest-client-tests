his is Alternative warn and die for modules.
The Carp routines are useful in own modules because they act like
die() or warn(), but with a message which is more likely to be useful to a
user of module. For a shorter message can use carp or croak which report the error as being from where your
module was called.

Refer http://perldoc.perl.org/Carp.html for details 

How to run the test:
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/perl-Carp
./perl-Carp.sh
