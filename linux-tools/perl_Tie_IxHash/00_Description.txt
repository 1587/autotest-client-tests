Tie::IxHash - ordered associative arrays for Perl
This Perl module implements Perl hashes that preserve the order in which the hash elements were added.
The order is not affected when values corresponding to existing keys in the IxHash are changed.
The elements can also be set to any arbitrary supplied order.
The familiar perl array operations can also be performed on the IxHash.

Usage:
To run all tests:

cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/perl-Tie-IxHash
./perl-Tie-IxHash.sh

To run test individually:
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/perl-Tie-IxHash
perl t/<test.t>
