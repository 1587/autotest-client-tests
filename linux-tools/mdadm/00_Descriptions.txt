mdadm
        Test the functionality of mdadm.

	CSDL: Hu Chenli<huchenli@cn.ibm.com>
usage:
	mdadm.sh (use loop back devices as softraid partitions)
	
Make sure RAIDTYPE(i.e. linear, 0, 1, 5) set in the testscript is supported by your kernel config.
eg:
# cat /proc/mdstat 
Personalities : [raid0] [raid1] 
unused devices: <none>

the above output suggests support for raid0 and raid1
