portreserve - reserve ports to prevent portmap mapping them.

The portreserve program aims to help services with well-known ports
that lie in the bindresvport range. It prevents portmap (or other
programs using bindresvport) from occupying a real serviceÂ´s port by
occupying it itself, until the real service tells it to release the
port (generally in its init script).

Run the test:
---------------
./portreserve.sh


        TODO
--------------------------------------------------
Note: As of now our test script only test the simple
functionality of portreserve and portrelease command.

portrelease doesnt have proper error reporting
which may confuse a service to start using a port.

Once the feature is in , we need to include
negative scenarios in our test script.
