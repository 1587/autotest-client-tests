The screen utility allows you to have multiple logins on
just one terminal. Screen is useful for users who telnet into a machine
or are connected via a dumb terminal, but want to use more than just one login.

Install the screen package if you need a screen manager that can support
multiple logins on one terminal

How to run the test:
-------------------
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/screen
./screen.sh
