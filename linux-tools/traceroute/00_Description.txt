traceroute : A traceroute, is a way to see how information travels from one computer
to another. Usually, information sent from one computer requires several computers to
transmit the information. A traceroute identifies each computer on that list, and the
amount of time it takes to get from one computer to another. If there is an interruption
in the transfer of data, the traceroute will show where in the chain the problem occurred.
The information that travels along the traceroute is known as 'packets.' Generally, a
traceroute will display three separate columns for the hop time, as each traceroute sends
out three separate packets of information to each computer. Sometimes a traceroute will
show one hop time, with the next two columns displaying asterisks. This usually indicates
that although one packet was accepted by the computer, the other two packets were discarded.
This is due to security concerns, many computers routinely reject multiple packages, or
forward them to different sources.

How to run the test:
--------------------
./traceroute.sh
