tmpwatch is a handy tool for administrators to delete unwanted files
automatically by checking their timestamp, which could be access time
(default), modification time or change time.

Along with other fancy options, there are two useful options
  "--fuser" - to remove file only after checking with fuser command.
  "--exclude-user" - do not remove files owned by this user.

FIV test design is to
1. delete a dir once its access time is more than a minute now.
2. delete a dir once its modification time is more than a minute now.
3. delete a dir once its change time is more than a minute now.
   FYI, change time is reflected when file inode is undergoing change
   in its meta data like permission mode.
4. delete a dir by checking along with fuser.
5. delete a dir by checking along with exclude-user.

To run tests: ./tmpwatch.sh
