The ebtables program is a filtering tool for a Linux-based bridging firewall.
It enables transparent filtering of network traffic passing through a Linux bridge.
The filtering possibilities are limited to link layer filtering and some basic filtering on higher network layers.

The ebtables tool can be combined with the other Linux filtering tools
(iptables, ip6tables and arptables) to make a bridging firewall that is also capable of filtering these higher
network layers. This is enabled through the bridge-netfilter (br-nf) architecture which is a part of the
standard Linux kernel.

HOW TO RUN:
----------
cd /opt/fiv/ltp/testcases/fivextra/ebtables
./ebtables.sh
