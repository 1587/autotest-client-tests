	Tested functionality of the rpm command and other commands in the rpm.rpm


rpm-python.sh

rpm-python introduces the high-level RPM API for Python programming.
You can use this API from Python scripts to perform RPM functionality, e.g.
   To query the RPM database, call dbMatch on the transaction set object.
   To install or upgrade packages, call addInstall, check, order, and run on the transaction set.

In general, the Python API is simpler and requires fewer code statements than the corresponding functionality in the C API.

Python testcases are adapted from http://fedora.redhat.com/docs/drafts/rpm-guide-en/ch-rpm-programming-python.html
